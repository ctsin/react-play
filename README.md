Preparation

Prisma VS Code extension

1. npm i -D prisma
2. npx prisma init
3. update prisma schema file
   ```
   datasource db {
    provider=
    url=
   }
   ```
4. define schema
5. npx prisma generate
6. npx prisma db push 会自动 generate
7. Node server 要重启，使之生效？ `npm run dev`

```sh
# 1. Update your schema.prisma file
# 2. Push changes to database
npx prisma db push

# 3. Generate updated client
npx prisma generate
```

# Restart the dev server after schema updated

> Generated by Amazon Q

restarting the Node server is mandatory after running npx prisma generate. Here's why:

When you need to restart:

- After npx prisma generate - Updates TypeScript types and client code
- After schema changes + npx prisma db push - Database structure changes
- After installing new dependencies that affect the runtime

Why restart is needed:

- Node.js caches imported modules in memory
- The Prisma client is imported at startup (import prisma from "~/lib/prisma")
- The old client with outdated types remains in memory until restart

Typical Prisma workflow:

```sh
# 1. Update schema.prisma
# 2. Push to database (also runs generate)
npx prisma db push

# 3. Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

Alternative: Some dev servers support hot reloading of dependencies, but Prisma client changes typically require a full restart to ensure the new generated code is properly loaded.

So yes, the restart was necessary to load the newly generated Prisma client with the correct TypeScript types matching your schema.

> [!CAUTION] If you choose not to use one, avoid instantiating PrismaClient globally in long-lived environments. Instead, create and dispose of the client per request to prevent exhausting your database connections. https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/react-router-7

# Welcome to React Router!

A modern, production-ready template for building full-stack React applications using React Router.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/default)

## Features

- 🚀 Server-side rendering
- ⚡️ Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- 📦 Asset bundling and optimization
- 🔄 Data loading and mutations
- 🔒 TypeScript by default
- 🎉 TailwindCSS for styling
- 📖 [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
